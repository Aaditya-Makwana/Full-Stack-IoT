# Full-Stack-IoT

This project includes the development of an IoT system. Initial configurations include the understanding of ModBus protocol. We will be writing ModBus codes which will allows us to communicate between two ESP-WROOM-32 controllers.

The basic description of code files will be updated in the ReadMe.
Thank you!
